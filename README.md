# Assessing-NHS-Scotland-s-Budget-Allocation
## Report
There exists a phenomenon of NHS strikes. Staff workload and NHS budget allocation are topics worth discussing. Therefore, we created a bubble chart and assessed relationships between staff workload, budget and area of each NHS in Scotland, aiming to address a business question “whether the budget of the NHS in Scotland is allocated appropriately”.

We used patient-to-staff ratio to measure staff workload, meaning how many patients on average 1 staff is responsible for. We expected to assess whether NHS with higher patient-to-staff ratio or larger area receive more budget, and whether NHS with larger areas have higher patient-to-staff ratios.

However, results were unexpected. As shown, no correlation between patient-to-staff ratios and areas. NHS with small area (e.g. Greater Glasgow and Clyde) had the highest total budgets. NHS with high patient-to-staff ratio (e.g. Lanarkshire and Forth Valley) received less budget. Therefore, we concluded the budget allocation of Scottish NHS may be unreasonable.

So the government and the NHS should be concerned with reasonable budget allocation based on the size of the area and the patient-to-staff ratio. For instance, providing more budget support to NHS in Lanarkshire and Forth Valley or hiring more staff to reduce workload. This may avoid employment inequalities, preventing attracting more staff in well-funded, low-workload NHS like Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

-  Distribution by Area: The institutions are spread across various sizes, ranging from small to over 30,000 square kilometers. There seems to be no clear correlation between the area of the institution and the patient-to-staff ratio. Institutions like NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde cover a smaller area but show a wide range of patient-to-staff ratios.

-  Budget Allocation: While not directly shown in the chart, the narrative suggests that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which occupies a smaller area, has a higher total budget. In contrast, NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Forth Valley, indicated by higher patient-to-staff ratios, receive less budget, suggesting that budget allocation may not be proportionate to workload or area.

-  Patient-to-Staff Ratios: There is variability in patient-to-staff ratios across the institutions. A higher ratio could indicate a higher workload for staff and could be a concern for staff well-being and patient care quality. Institutions like NHS Highland cover a large area and have a moderate patient-to-staff ratio, which might be considered reasonable given the context.

-  No Clear Correlation: The lack of a visible correlation on the chart suggests that neither the size of the institution's area nor the patient-to-staff ratio is a determining factor in how the budget is allocated. This implies that other factors may be influencing budget decisions.

-  Concerns for Policy: The analysis could be used to argue for a reassessment of budget allocation policies, advocating for a distribution that takes into account the actual workload and the geographical coverage area of each institution.

-  Implications for Staffing and Coverage: The current budget allocation may impact the ability to attract and retain staff, particularly in areas with higher workloads but lower budgets. Redistribution of funds or a revision in staffing strategies might be needed to ensure equitable healthcare service across Scotland.

In conclusion, the chart prompts further questions regarding the criteria used for NHS budget allocations in Scotland and suggests the need for a review to ensure fair and efficient use of resources, particularly in regions showing a disparity between budget allocation and the patient-to-staff workload.
